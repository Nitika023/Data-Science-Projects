Title: Autoencoder for Recognizing Digits and First Character of Your First Name

Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to create an autoencoder that can identify ten digits and the first letter of the user's first name. The project involves creating images of the first letter of the user's first name, loading the MNIST dataset, training a new autoencoder, and demonstrating the new encoding.

Step 1: Create Images of the First Letter of Your First Name
To begin, the user must create five 28x28 pixel images of the first letter of their first name. These images must be saved as PNG files and have a black background and a white letter.

Step 2: Load MNIST Dataset and Display Predictions
Next, the MNIST dataset is loaded into a notebook, and the provided autoencoder (digits.a5) is also loaded. Predictions for several random digits are displayed to evaluate the performance of the autoencoder.

Step 3: Train a New Autoencoder
In this step, a new autoencoder is created and trained with the MNIST dataset and the five images of the first letter of the user's first name. The images are oversampled and added to the MNIST dataset to ensure the model can identify the new character.

Step 4: Demonstrate Your New Encoding
Finally, the new autoencoder's performance is demonstrated by recreating a random set of digits and the user's first character.

Conclusion:
This project provides an opportunity to understand and experiment with autoencoders.
