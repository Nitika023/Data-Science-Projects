Comparing Performance of Three Modeling Approaches on MNIST Dataset
This project aims to compare the performance of three different modeling approaches for predicting handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely-used dataset for image recognition, and it consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Data
The MNIST dataset is used for this project, and it consists of a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is 28x28 pixels and is represented by a 784-dimensional vector. The data is preprocessed and normalized before being used for modeling purposes.

Modeling Approaches
Three different modeling approaches are used for this project: logistic regression, random forest, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Logistic regression is a simple linear model that is commonly used for classification tasks. Random forest is an ensemble method that is known for its high accuracy and robustness. CNN is a deep learning approach that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on image recognition tasks.

Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation metrics are used to compare the performance of the three models and to determine which model performs the best for predicting handwritten digits.

Conclusion
The MNIST dataset is a widely-used dataset for image recognition tasks, and it provides a good benchmark for comparing the performance of different modeling approaches. This project demonstrates the use of three different modeling approaches for predicting handwritten digits and compares their performance using various evaluation metrics. The results of this project can be used to inform decisions about which modeling approach to use for similar image recognition tasks.
